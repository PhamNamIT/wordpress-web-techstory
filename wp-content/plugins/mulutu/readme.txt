== About Mulutu platform (3rd service) ==
To help users at Vietnam fast create woocommerce order shipping, we also created a service called "Mulutu platform" and it's APIs.
This "Mulutu plugin" will send some neccessary woocommerce order info to "Mulutu platform" above (sender address(be settled at plugin installation), receiver address).
With the response from Mulutu platform and it's apis, this plugin can:
 - Show available order shipping fee prices.
 - Create shipping order with favourite shipping providers.
 - Manage shipping orders:
    + Create shipping order.
    + Update shipping order.
    + Delete shipping order.
    + View shipping order history.
    + Tracking order shipping status.
    + Print shipping order.
 - Fast create and manage the support requests from shipping providers.
